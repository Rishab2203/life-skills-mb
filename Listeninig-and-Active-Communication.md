# Listening and Active Communication

## Question 1 What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)

* Pay Attention: Focus entirely on the speaker, minimizing external distractions. This shows respect and signals that you value what they're saying.

* Show That You're Listening: Use non-verbal cues like nodding, maintaining eye contact, and appropriate facial expressions to demonstrate engagement.

* Provide Feedback: Reflect on what's been said by paraphrasing or summarizing. For example, "What I'm hearing is..." or "It sounds like you're saying...". This confirms your understanding and clarifies any ambiguities.

* Defer Judgment: Allow the speaker to finish their thoughts without interrupting or forming counter-arguments prematurely. This fosters a safe environment for open communication.

* Respond Appropriately: Offer thoughtful responses, whether through questions or comments, that are relevant to the speaker's points. This indicates that you've processed the information and are engaged in the conversation.

* Observe Non-Verbal Cues: Pay attention to the speaker's body language, tone, and facial expressions, as these can provide additional context to their words.
