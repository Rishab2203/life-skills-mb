# Tiny Habits

## Question 1   In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?


In BJ Fogg's TEDx talk, he suggests starting with very small actions to build new habits. For example, he recommends flossing just one tooth. This simple step makes it easier to begin and can lead to flossing all your teeth regularly over time. By keeping the initial action small, it's less daunting, and you're more likely to stick with it, eventually leading to significant personal change.

## Question 2   How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.


In BJ Fogg's Behavior Model (B=MAP), a behavior occurs when Motivation (M), Ability (A), and Prompt (P) converge simultaneously. To form new habits, you can:

* Increase Motivation: Align the habit with your personal values or desired outcomes.

* Enhance Ability: Simplify the habit to make it easier to perform.

* Utilize Prompts: Use clear cues or reminders to trigger the behavior.

By optimizing these elements, you can effectively establish and maintain new habits. 

## Question 3 Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

Celebrating, or "shining," after completing a habit is crucial because it reinforces the behavior through positive emotions. This immediate positive feedback creates a sense of success and satisfaction, making you more likely to repeat the behavior in the future. By consistently celebrating small wins, you train your brain to associate the habit with positive feelings, thereby solidifying it as a regular part of your routine. As BJ Fogg emphasizes, "Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit."

## Question 4  In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

In James Clear's talk, "1% Better Every Day," he emphasizes the profound impact of small, consistent improvements. He illustrates this with the concept of marginal gains, explaining that a 1% improvement each day leads to significant progress over time. This approach highlights the power of compounding in personal development. 

## Question 5  What is the book's perspective about Identity?

In "Atomic Habits," James Clear emphasizes that true behavior change stems from identity transformation. Instead of solely focusing on outcomes or specific actions, Clear advocates for adopting the identity of the person you aspire to become. For instance, rather than aiming to read a certain number of books, identify as a reader; instead of setting a goal to run a marathon, embrace the identity of a runner. This shift in self-perception makes actions aligned with that identity more natural and sustainable. Clear suggests that by focusing on "identity-based habits," individuals can achieve lasting change, as these habits become an integral part of who they are.

## Question 6  Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?


In "Atomic Habits," James Clear emphasizes that making a habit easier to perform significantly increases the likelihood of its adoption and sustainability. He introduces the concept of the "Two-Minute Rule," which suggests that any new habit should take no more than two minutes to start. This approach lowers the barrier to entry, making the habit feel more manageable and less intimidating. For example, if your goal is to read more, begin by reading just one page each day. This simplicity encourages consistency and helps in building momentum. By focusing on the initial two minutes, you can establish a routine that naturally extends over time. 

## Question 7 Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

In "Atomic Habits," James Clear suggests making bad habits harder to perform by increasing friction. This involves adding obstacles or inconveniences to the initiation of a bad habit, making it less appealing and harder to execute.

Strategies to Make Bad Habits Harder:

1. Increase Physical Effort: Place items associated with the bad habit out of easy reach. For example, if you want to reduce screen time, keep your phone in another room while working.

2. Add Time Delays: Introduce steps that require time before the habit can be performed. For instance, if you're trying to cut down on junk food, make it a rule to wait 10 minutes before eating any snack. This pause can help reduce impulsive decisions.

3. Remove Triggers: Identify and eliminate cues that prompt the bad habit. If you tend to snack while watching TV, consider changing your routine or environment to break the association.

4. Make the Behavior Unpleasant: Associate the bad habit with negative consequences. For example, if you're trying to stop smoking, you might use a bitter-tasting mouthwash after smoking to create an unpleasant experience.

By implementing these strategies, you increase the effort required to engage in bad habits, making them less automatic and easier to avoid. This approach aligns with Clear's principle that "the more friction you add to a bad habit, the less likely it is to occur."

## **5. Reflection**  
### **Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps you can take to make the cue obvious, the habit more attractive, or the response satisfying?**  
**Habit:** Reading 20 pages of a book daily.  
**Steps:**  
- **Cue:** Place the book on my pillow or desk as a visible reminder.  
- **Make it attractive:** Pair reading with something enjoyable, like sipping coffee.  
- **Make it satisfying:** Track daily reading progress on a calendar and reward myself with a small treat at the end of the week.

### **Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps you can take to make the cue invisible, the process unattractive, or the response unsatisfying?**  
**Habit:** Mindless scrolling on social media.  
**Steps:**  
- **Make the cue invisible:** Remove social media apps from the home screen or uninstall them.  
- **Make it unattractive:** Set time limits or reminders about the negative impact of excessive screen time.  
- **Make it unsatisfying:** Enlist an accountability partner or use an app that tracks and reports screen usage to discourage overuse.
